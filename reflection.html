      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700">üìò Summary of My Internship</h2>
      <p>
        My internship at Mandai Wildlife Group was a dynamic journey through real-world applications of AI, RPA, and digital transformation. From creating Power Automate bots for procurement, to assisting in field operations, to filming the ‚ÄúProject 100K‚Äù townhall video, every week offered unique learning opportunities. I learned to collaborate with departments like HR, Park Ops, and Vets‚Äîadapting to their workflows and contributing automation where possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        My highlight was leading the ideation, filming, and editing of a video project that got featured in a company-wide townhall. I also explored Microsoft‚Äôs Power Platform, Miro workflow design, OCR preprocessing, and AI prompt tuning for Copilot365. Weekly retrospectives, debriefs, and brainstorming sessions became core routines that shaped my work ethic and problem-solving mindset.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700">üß† Technical Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        One major breakthrough for me was learning the importance of OCR pre-processing‚Äîmanipulating images before extraction dramatically improved results. I also developed automation scripts that replaced repetitive tasks like manual image saving, streamlining entire workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I explored prompt engineering with Microsoft Copilot365, investigated hallucination filtering, and collaborated on RPA workflows that integrated data into Excel and SharePoint. Overcoming technical bugs by contacting Microsoft support and testing iterative solutions taught me resilience and debugging practices in real environments.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700">üå± My Experience at Mandai</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, my internship was filled with growth, challenges, and pride. The company‚Äôs inclusive culture, mentorship from the Transformation Office, and hands-on learning environments like field volunteering and workshops pushed me out of my comfort zone. I especially appreciated the emphasis on learning-by-doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now feel much more confident in my skills as an AI & RPA engineering intern. I‚Äôve learned to think from both a user‚Äôs and a developer‚Äôs perspective, to consider ethics and impact, and to communicate technical value to stakeholders effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        This internship has confirmed my passion for combining automation, AI, and creative problem solving‚Äîand I‚Äôm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what I can build.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700">📘 Summary of My Internship</h2>
      <p>
        My internship with Mandai’s Transformation Office was nothing short of transformative. It offered me a rare
        opportunity to work across technical automation, creative media production, and real-world workflow redesign —
        all within a mission-driven environment focused on conservation and wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        From day one, I was trusted with responsibilities that challenged me to step out of my comfort zone — whether it
        was automating procurement processes using RPA or scripting interviews for a company-wide townhall video. Each
        week came with new domains, new departments, and new expectations which pushed me to adapt quickly and learn
        independently.
      </p>
      <p>
        I collaborated with zookeepers, HR teams, procurement staff, and even technology partners to understand pain
        points and design solutions that made a difference. It wasn’t just a technical role; it was a people-first
        experience that showed me the value of empathy in digital transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, I have developed a full working RPA bot, presented work at a townhall, tested GenAI
        tools, and built a multi-page digital portfolio — a true culmination of all the skills I had cultivated. I
        have not only become more skilled, but more assured of the kind of impact I want to create in the
        world.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700">🧠 Technical Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        On the technical front, this internship gave me robust exposure to low-code platforms, automation frameworks,
        and AI experimentation. I worked extensively with <strong>Microsoft Power Automate Desktop</strong> to build RPA
        bots that handled file downloads, exception handling, SharePoint uploads, and dynamic naming conventions. I
        learned to fine-tune selectors, configure retry logic, and structure workflows modularly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I explored <strong>prompt engineering</strong> within <strong>Microsoft Copilot 365</strong>,
        crafting scenarios to test hallucinations, tune outputs, and create role-specific question templates. I also
        dealt with permission bugs in SharePoint Forms and implemented domain-wide access solutions — improving my
        understanding of Microsoft ecosystems and security layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside automation, I dabbled in <strong>data visualisation using Excel PivotTables</strong>, dashboard logic
        using Power BI, and conducted experiments with <strong>GenAI platforms</strong> like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini,
        and Copilot. I analysed platform bias and brand visibility to extract tangible business insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also deepened my ability to <strong>communicate technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders</strong> — using
        diagrams, visuals, and simplified walkthroughs. Whether it was building flowcharts in Miro, creating media edits
        in Filmora, or testing AI integrations — I walked away with a stronger, more practical toolkit to build
        real-world impact.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700">🌱 My Experience at Mandai</h2>
      <p>
        What stood out most during my internship at Mandai Wildlife Group was not just the technology, tools, or
        workflows — it was the <strong>deep-rooted culture of humility, mission, and people-first thinking</strong>.
        From the moment I joined, I was welcomed into a team that prioritised collaboration, mutual respect, and
        continuous learning. I wasn’t seen as “just an intern,” but as a full contributor trusted with real projects and
        real outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working alongside zookeepers, HR personnel, procurement staff, and senior innovation leads gave me an incredibly
        diverse exposure to how conservation and operational excellence intersect. The fieldwork I did during the DILO
        (Day-in-the-Life) observations was humbling — I scrubbed floors, prepped food, lifted buckets, and saw firsthand
        the emotional and physical toll that animal care teams endure. Yet, not once did I feel out of place. Everyone I
        interacted with — from the South Zone Herbivore Team to transformation stakeholders took the time to explain,
        include, and support me.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest cultural takeaways for me was Mandai’s ability to blend <strong>tradition with
          innovation</strong>. Despite its legacy as a beloved wildlife institution, the group is embracing AI,
        automation, and digital tools to stay future-ready — and I was right in the middle of it. I got to build bots
        that genuinely saved staff time, design visuals that simplified communication, and even script a story that
        captured organisational values in a townhall video. I saw how even small tech-driven improvements could have
        ripple effects across wellbeing, time management, and guest experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I’ll carry forward from this internship isn’t just the skills or portfolio pieces — it’s a mindset. I’ve
        learned to lead with empathy, to stay curious, and to always understand the human impact behind every workflow
        or codebase I touch. I’ve seen how technology, when grounded in compassion and clarity, can uplift not just
        operations, but people’s everyday lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, Mandai didn’t just teach me how to be a better intern — it taught me how to be a <strong>more
          thoughtful and impactful innovator</strong>. And for that, I will always be grateful.

        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          My internship at Mandai was an interdisciplinary journey that blended <strong>AI, automation, operational
            research, and innovation strategy</strong>. I served as an Innovation and Technology Management Associate
          Trainee under the
          Transformation Office, and my work spanned three core domains: <strong>technical solutioning</strong>,
          <strong>process improvement</strong>, and <strong>people-centric engagement</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          I developed a fully functional <strong>Power Automate RPA bot</strong> to automate procurement workflows ‚Äî
          extracting and sorting files from Mandai‚Äôs e-procurement portal and uploading them to SharePoint using binary
          conversion logic. I also <strong>designed and tested enterprise-level prompts for Microsoft Copilot</strong>
          to ensure safe, accurate outputs for membership queries using frameworks like RACE and CARE.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          Beyond automation, I led a <strong>GenAI tourism benchmarking study</strong> comparing how Mandai‚Äôs parks were
          represented across 10 major LLMs, visualised via Excel dashboards. I <strong>conducted chatbot
            testing</strong> for HR‚Äôs internal assistant, evaluated AI receipt detection models using confidence scores,
          and mapped ground workflows through <strong>DILO (Day-In-The-Life)</strong> observations using Miro.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          On the creative side, I <strong>produced a 100-second Townhall video</strong> that was showcased to the entire
          organisation ‚Äî planning, interviewing, and editing it independently. From scriptwriting and lighting setup to
          GoPro camera work and post-production in Filmora, the project exemplified how <em>digital storytelling can be
            a tool for transformation</em>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          Every week involved switching hats ‚Äî from <strong>technical tester to researcher, from field observer to
            storyteller</strong>. What connected them all was a commitment to making work more meaningful, systems more
          intelligent, and transformation more inclusive. That was the true nature of work at Mandai.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-yellow-600 text-center mb-3">üöß Challenges Faced üöß</h3>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          This internship challenged me in more ways than I expected ‚Äî technically, logistically, and emotionally. On
          the automation front, debugging <strong>Power Automate selectors</strong> and handling bot crashes during file
          extraction created unpredictable delays. Writing reliable file logic while ensuring SharePoint uploads
          remained stable under dynamic folder structures required constant iteration and testing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          Content-wise, juggling the <strong>MyProject100K Townhall video</strong> while also progressing technical
          deliverables stretched my ability to multitask. Coordinating interviews with <strong>HR, Park Ops, and Vet
            departments</strong> meant adapting to shifting schedules, managing nervous speakers, and troubleshooting
          gear like GoPro mic syncing ‚Äî all under tight internal deadlines.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          There were also UX hurdles ‚Äî such as <strong>Microsoft Forms access errors</strong> caused by internal domain
          restrictions and <strong>receipt recognition tests</strong> failing due to poor image quality or OCR
          hallucination. Each problem forced me to think differently, whether it was stepping into prompt engineering
          frameworks, rewriting flows from scratch, or gathering clearer requirements through user testing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          These setbacks pushed me to become more resilient, resourceful, and comfortable navigating ambiguity. I
          learned that challenges are not just blockers ‚Äî they‚Äôre feedback signals that help you grow your edge.
        </p>

      <div class="p-6 bg-white/30 backdrop-blur-lg rounded-xl border border-blue-300 shadow-lg" data-aos="fade-up"
        data-aos-delay="200">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 text-center mb-3">üìà Learning & Growth</h3>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          My learning journey during this internship was exponential. I deepened my technical foundation through
          hands-on experience with <strong>Power Automate Desktop</strong>, mastering flow design, condition branches,
          error handling, and file system logic. I expanded into <strong>prompt engineering</strong> using frameworks
          like RACE and CARE to reduce hallucination in <strong>Microsoft Copilot</strong> responses especially when
          retrieving park and membership data.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          I also developed data storytelling skills using <strong>Excel pivot tables and dashboards</strong> to
          visualise GenAI benchmarking insights. Through SharePoint automation and <strong>UI selector
            debugging</strong>, I gained deeper knowledge of access management, workflows, and testing methodology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          Soft skills grew in parallel. I led cross-functional discussions during stakeholder demos, navigated feedback
          rounds from multiple departments, and facilitated <strong>interview filming sessions</strong> with empathy and
          structure. I learned to manage competing project priorities, stay calm under production pressure, and
          communicate my technical ideas to non-technical users.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          This internship grew me not just as a builder, but as a problem-solver, communicator, and a future
          <strong>solutions architect</strong> who can connect people, systems, and purpose through technology.

          productivity. I grew not just as a technical student ‚Äî but as a communicator, collaborator, and critical
          thinker through this internship.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto mt-4">
          I feel more grounded in purpose, more agile in mindset, and more certain about the
          kind of tech professional I want to become ‚Äî one who solves problems not for scale alone, but for people. This
          internship didn‚Äôt just point me forward ‚Äî it gave me direction, meaning, and a deep appreciation for
          transformation that begins with heart.

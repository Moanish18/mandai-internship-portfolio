        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          My internship at Mandai was a blend of innovation, empathy, and purpose. I was immersed in a multi-faced role
          that cut across automation engineering, digital storytelling, and ground-level operations. From writing UI
          automation logic in Power Automate Desktop, to planning and directing a company-wide townhall video, I got to
          wear many hats. Whether it was analysing GenAI performance, mapping zoo keeper workflows, or filming on-site
          at clinics and exhibit areas, every task was uniquely rooted in sustainability and transformation.

        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          The internship wasn’t without its hurdles. There were days when a single UI selector bug could block the
          entire automation pipeline. There were moments when managing interviews and bot deployments simultaneously
          felt overwhelming. Coordinating across HR, Procurement, Park Ops, and the Vet teams tested my cross-functional
          communication. But each challenge — from debugging login flows to adapting storyboards on the fly — taught me
          how to stay calm, adapt quickly, and persevere with clarity.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 text-center mb-3">📈 Learning & Growth</h3>
        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          This internship was a growth curve that felt more like a rocket trajectory. I picked up Power BI for data
          visualisation, explored SharePoint workflows, learned to design user-friendly flows in Power Automate, and tested
          Microsoft Copilot prompts using prompt engineering strategies. Beyond tools, I gained domain knowledge in
          procurement processes, HR onboarding, and operational scheduling. I also practiced leadership — from guiding
          filming crews to leading user testing discussions. My ability to break down complex problems, communicate
          across teams, and think systemically grew week by week.

        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          I see myself at the intersection of AI, automation, and sustainable innovation. My aspiration is to become a
          solutions architect who blends empathy and engineering — one who understands how people interact with systems,
          and builds tools that make lives better. Whether it’s creating AI-driven agents that answer real-world queries
          or building RPA workflows that reduce human fatigue, I want my work to feel meaningful. Eventually, I want to
          lead projects that sit at the nexus of technology, conservation, and social good — using my skills to create
          tech for good, not just tech for scale.

        <p class="text-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          This internship was more than just a resume bullet. It was a transformational journey that reshaped how I
          approach work, people, and technology. It taught me that real impact isn’t always in lines of code —
          sometimes, it’s in the way a problem is framed, how users feel, and how teammates grow together. I walk away
          more grounded, more curious, and deeply inspired to build systems that are human-centered, ethical, and
          empowering. The road ahead is long, but this experience was the perfect compass.

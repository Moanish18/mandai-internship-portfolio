        <p class="text-gray-800">
          Before filming, we planned the interview structure and created a visual storyboard covering all 5 segments of
          the video:
          intro, speaker snippets, b-roll montage, question transitions, and outro message. Questions were designed to
          be
          <strong>reflective,
            open-ended, and emotionally engaging</strong>. We collaborated with the Transformation Office to identify
          speakers from various departments
          (e.g. Vets, HR, Park Ops) and scheduled filming slots in <strong>real workplace environments</strong> such as
          zoo entrance, office corners,

          Filming was conducted with a <strong>GoPro Hero 9</strong> and clip-on DJI Wireless microphones for
          optimal clarity. Each interview
          session lasted 45 minutes with multiple takes to ensure authentic delivery. I also captured b-roll footage
          of staff in action ‚Äî
          Doing animal health analysis, attending meetings, using systems or new applications. Each shot was
          intentionally framed to

          üéØ <strong>Filming Challenges:</strong> We worked under time constraints and limited indoor lighting. Some

          The video was polished with visual transitions and

          done with care, speed, and deep awareness of animal welfare even when resources were stretched. Seeing their
          hustle made
          me realise how even small inefficiencies in a workflow can have ripple effects on wellbeing, morale, and
          guest-facing time. <br /><br />
          Through this project, I learned that digital transformation must be grounded in empathy. It‚Äôs not just about
          process
          diagrams and automation ideas ‚Äî it‚Äôs about designing solutions that <strong>truly support the people</strong>
          on the ground.
          This experience taught me to be more observant, more patient, and above all, more human in my approach to
          problem-solving.

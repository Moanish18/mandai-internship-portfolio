        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">📆 Week 1 (14–18 April)</h2>
        <p>Kickstarted my internship journey with onboarding at the Corporate Office. I collected my equipment and got
          briefed on Mandai's vision. I was immediately looped into a core project — the <strong>MyProject100K townhall
            video</strong>. Brainstormed storyboard ideas and planned interview structures. Additionally, I tested an
          internal HR chatbot prototype for usability and responsiveness. I also initiated a comparative GenAI analysis
          using 8 different platforms to gauge how Mandai parks are featured in AI-generated tourism content. This
          foundational week set the tone for what would be a highly dynamic internship experience. (18th April was a
          public holiday)</p>

        data-aos="fade-right">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">📆 Week 2 (21–25 April)</h2>
        <p>Processed and visualised results from the GenAI comparison project using Power BI dashboards. Joined the Park
          Operations team for a volunteering session feeding giraffes — an incredible firsthand look into animal care
          processes. Attended <strong>GITEX Asia</strong>, one of the region’s biggest tech events, where I explored
          AI-powered robots, AR tools, and smart agriculture innovations. Also started automating procurement workflows
          with Power Automate Desktop. This week blended tech, nature, and inspiration perfectly.</p>

      <!-- WEEK 3 -->
      <div

        data-aos="fade-right">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">📆 Week 3 (28 April–2 May)</h2>
        <p>Completed a working prototype of the <strong>Procurement RPA bot</strong> that automates file downloads,
          renaming, and classification. Simultaneously progressed with video project logistics — finalised filming
          equipment, scheduled interviews, and created script drafts. I explored AI-powered image recognition tools and
          implemented confidence scoring for potential use cases in internal workflows. Attended a Power BI masterclass
          and debriefed the “Day-In-The-Life” workflow observation with team leads to streamline process mapping in
          Miro.</p>

        data-aos="fade-right">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">📆 Week 4 (5–9 May)</h2>
        <p>Started developing a <strong>GenAI summary bot</strong> that extracts key highlights from lengthy web
          articles using prompt engineering. Conducted GoPro + mic testing in different field environments to ensure
          quality audio for interviews. Participated in a <strong>Power Apps workshop</strong> and AWS IoT Lab, gaining
          experience in low-code app development and real-time sensor integrations. Reached out to HR and Veterinary
          departments to align timelines for upcoming interview shoots. Deployed the second automation script
          successfully.</p>

        data-aos="fade-right">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">🎥 Week 5 (12–16 May)</h2>
        <p>Facilitated a feedback session with Park Ops on improvements derived from the workflow mapping. Carried out
          <strong>video interviews with HR, Vet, and Park Ops teams</strong> for Project 100K. Managed lighting,
          background
          setup, and question delivery while filming. Drafted the first video cut in Filmora. Balanced the creative
          responsibilities of media production while maintaining RPA workflow testing and enhancements in parallel.
          Learned how to multitask across completely different domains efficiently.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">🧠 Week 6 (19–23 May)</h2>
        <p>Finalised and exported the <strong>Project 100K video</strong> for review by senior leadership and prepared
          it for the Townhall. Meanwhile, I made process upgrades to the Procurement Bot, including dynamic folder
          creation and improved exception handling. Collaborated with Microsoft’s technical team to debug a web
          automation bug in Power Automate, learning about authentication flows and selectors. This week felt like a
          breakthrough — both creative and technical deliverables hit maturity.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">🏁 Week 7 (26–30 May)</h2>
        <p>Balanced refinement of the Web Automation and Procurement bots. The highlight was seeing our Project 100K
          video showcased during Mandai’s company-wide townhall. It received great feedback and marked one of my
          proudest milestones. Wrapped up QA testing and began technical documentation for bot deployment. Understood
          the importance of presentation, communication, and visual storytelling in corporate contexts.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">🔧 Week 8–9 (2–13 June)</h2>
        <p>Focused purely on backend bot logic — restructuring flows for scalability and refining UI steps. Took part in
          a <strong>5S cleanup</strong> in Zebra feeding zone to optimise space and process. Created visual flow
          diagrams to explain bot steps to non-tech users. Finalised retry logic, form data mapping, and completed
          integration testing. These weeks were intense but deeply satisfying as I got to polish and productionise the
          bot from start to finish.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">📋 Week 10–11 (16–27 June)</h2>
        <p>Held enhancement sessions with the Procurement department to further tailor the bot logic to real business
          use cases. Delivered the <strong>final demo</strong> to HOD, received valuable feedback, and implemented minor
          tweaks. Completed a full documentation package including screenshots, explanations, and maintenance tips for
          future interns. Handed over the final version and archived workflows for auditing. Marked the successful
          closure of my first major automation deployment.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-2">🧪 Week 12 (30 June–1 July)</h2>
        <p>Explored <strong>prompt engineering strategies</strong> for Microsoft 365 Copilot, focusing on hallucination
          detection and user safety. Also worked on permission debugging inside SharePoint-based Microsoft Forms that
          blocked image rendering. This week was short but filled with exciting experimentation and showed me how
          emerging AI tools will evolve in enterprise use.</p>

        <p>Kickstarted my internship journey with onboarding at the Transformation Office. I collected my equipment and
          got briefed on Mandai's vision. I was immediately looped into a core project which was the
          <strong>MyProject100K townhall video</strong>. Brainstormed storyboard ideas and planned interview structures.
          Additionally, I tested an internal HR chatbot prototype for usability and responsiveness. I also initiated a
          comparative GenAI analysis with my intern mates using 8 different platforms such as <em><strong>ChatGPT,
              Claude, Copilot,
              Grok</strong></em> to gauge how Mandai parks are featured in AI-generated tourism content. This
          foundational week set the tone for what would be a highly dynamic internship experience.

          renaming, and uploading them into Sharepoint. Simultaneously progressed with video project logistics —
          finalised filming
          equipment, scheduled interviews, and created script drafts. I explored AI-powered image recognition tools and
          implemented confidence scoring for potential use cases in internal workflows such as receipt detection.
          Attended a Power BI masterclass
          and debriefed the “Day-In-The-Life” workflow observation with team leads to streamline process mapping using

        <p>Finalised and exported the <strong>Project 100K video</strong> for review by senior leadership and prepared

          creation and improved exception handling. Collaborated with Microsoft’s technical team to debug a web
          automation bug in Power Automate, learning about authentication flows and selectors. This week felt like a

        <p>
          This week I took on an entirely new assignment focused on <strong>Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong>. I explored
          how to craft
          prompts that avoid hallucinations and ensure accurate, user-safe responses. I iterated on a
          <strong>query-specific
            prompt</strong> designed to provide Mandai’s park and membership prices while limiting fabrication.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also tackled permission debugging inside <strong>Microsoft Forms</strong> hosted on SharePoint. Uploaded
          images were
          not rendering for internal viewers, so I analysed access settings and made them visible to the Mandai
          domain. Later in the week, I researched <strong>Microsoft add-ins</strong> that could help staff productivity
          across
          Outlook,
          Teams, and SharePoint.
        </p>

        <p class="italic text-gray-800">
          🔍 <strong>Reflection:</strong> This was a week of deep experimentation. I learned how enterprise AI features
          like
          Copilot require careful prompt crafting and testing — especially when accuracy is critical. It also reminded
          me
          that sometimes the smallest things (like a missing permission) can affect access, perception, and
          productivity.

          This week, I explored <strong>Microsoft Add-ins</strong> that could enhance productivity within Mandai’s
          digital workspace. I focused on Outlook plugins that embed websites or workflows directly into the Microsoft
          ecosystem to streamline daily tasks. The goal was to identify tools that reduce digital friction and simplify
          employee operations. I also spent time refining my <strong>digital portfolio</strong> with my supervisor's
          feedback
          and
          began planning <strong>communication strategies</strong> for promoting the Transformation Office across
          departments —
          including through MS Teams, digital banners, and physical assets.

          the <strong>MyProject100K Award Ceremony</strong> and the upcoming <strong>Townhall Session on 5th
            August</strong>.
          I filmed short staff snippets, compiled and edited them into a cohesive video narrative, and enhanced the
          visuals
          for better impact. At the same time, I continued improving the <strong>communication strategy deck</strong>
          for the
          Transformation Office — integrating visual storytelling techniques and aligning with Mandai’s tone of voice.
          These back-to-back multimedia and messaging tasks helped me refine both my creativity and internal pitching

        <p>This week revolved around <strong>refining the Guest Journey understanding</strong> and <strong>finalising
            major video productions</strong> for internal Mandai events. I used MIRO to map out both the <strong>Guest
            and Staff Journey</strong> from discovery to park visit and post-visit experience. I also participated in a
          <strong>Transformation Office-led workshop</strong> to co-develop these process flows collaboratively with

        <p>In parallel, I was actively involved in the <strong>filming and editing</strong> of the <em>MyProject100K
